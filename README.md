Hi, I'm Marat â€” a dedicated open-source developer passionate about creating efficient and developer-friendly tools.

## My Focus Areas:

* **Developer Tooling**: My projects often revolve around enhancing developer productivity through tools that simplify complex tasks.
I'm currently actively contributing to [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), a next-generation JavaScript and TypeScript linter, formatter, and bundler that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for modern web development.

* **HTML Entity Handling**: I maintain [html-entities](https://github.com/mdevils/html-entities), a robust library for encoding and decoding HTML entities, widely used in web development projects.

* **CSS Selector Parsing**: I created [css-selector-parser](https://github.com/mdevils/css-selector-parser), a library that provides a fast and efficient way to parse CSS selectors, making it easier to work with styles in web applications.

* **TypeScript Exercieses**: The most popular set of [TypeScript exercises](https://typescript-exercises.github.io/), designed to help developers learn and practice TypeScript concepts effectively.

* **Rust crates**: I developed [osakit](https://crates.io/crates/osakit), a Rust interface to macOS's OSAKit framework, enabling seamless execution of AppleScript and JavaScript through native bindings.

## Previous Contributions:

* **JSCS**: A JavaScript Code Style checker that was widely used before being merged into ESLint.

* **ENB**: A pre-webpack era build tool for JavaScript projects, which I've developed and maintained for several years. 

## Why Open Source?

I believe in the power of collaboration and the open-source community's ability to drive innovation. By sharing my work, I aim to contribute to a more accessible and efficient development ecosystem.
